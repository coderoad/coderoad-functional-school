          "explanation": "You've hacked into the school's computer system, and just in time. The grades are in, aren't you're not too proud of your performance. But that's okay, you have a plan: you're going to create a fake report card.\n\nIt would be great if you could `filter` the scores that your parents will see. A `filter` takes a matching condition function and only returns items that result in true. As an example, look at `isA` below:\n\n```\nfunction isA(x) {\n  return x === 'a';\n}\n```\n\n\nLike all of the methods in this chapter, `filter` is already part of the `Array.prototype`, so you can run it following any array. Each item in the array is passed into the params of the condition function, one by one.\n\n```\nvar list = ['a', 'b'];\nlist.filter(isA);\n\n// if isA(list[0]), add to output array\n// if isA(list[1]), add to output array\n//\n//> ['a']\n```\n\nIf your data was composed of objects, we could use dot notation to find matches. Checkout `isB` below.\n\n```\nfunction isB(x) {\n  return x.item === 'b'\n}\n\nvar list = [{item: 'a'}, {item: 'b'}];\nlist.filter(isB);\n//> [{item: 'b'}]\n```\n\nWhere were we? Back to filtering our grades.\n\nThere's too much student data in the computer system. We'll have to sort through it. Have a look at an example below:\n\n```\nconsole.log(data[0]);\n//> { course: 'Web Security',\n//    instructor: 'Sue Denim',\n//    name: 'Rebecca Heineman',\n//    score: 93,\n//    grade: 'A' }\n```",

We can write a custom `compareScore` function.\n\nA sort function takes two params, and compares the first to the second. It should return values saying where the second value should go:\n\n  * -1 : sort to a lower index\n  * 1 : sort to a higher index\n  * 0 : stay the same\n\nAlright, now time to sort your best grades to the top.",

          "explanation": "You've updated your grades, but they're still in an array. It's time to loop over them and log them to the console.\n\n`forEach` has a lot in common with `map`, but the major differences between the two is important to understand the difference between \"functional\" & \"imperative\" programming.\n\n> Imperative programming describes the order of actions\n\n> Functional programming describes the data transformation\n\nFunctional programming is a lot like math. As in math, 1 + 1 always equals 2.\n\nIn the same way, a \"pure\" function will always have the same result from a given input. Input 1, output 2. Every time.\n\n```js\n// a pure function\nfunction addOne(x) {\n  return x + 1;\n}\naddOne(1)\n//> 2\naddOne(1)\n//> 2\n```\n\nA function is \"pure\" if it doesn't change anything outside of its scope. Pure functions are easy to test, reuse and reason about. On the other hand, \"impure\" functions are less predictable.\n\n```js\nvar y = 1;\n// impure function\nfunction increment(x) {\n  y += x;\n  return y;\n}\nincrement(1)\n//> 2\nincrement(1)\n//> 3\n```\n\nIt's good practice to ensure your `map` functions remain pure.\n\nBut `forEach` can be a little more dangerous. Why? Let's have a look.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(addOne);\n//> [2, 3, 4]\n//\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(addOne);\n//> undefined\n```\n\nWhat? `undefined`? `forEach` runs a function on each item in the array, and doesn't care what the function returns. The function must make changes, called \"side effects\", to even be noticed.\n\n```js\n// impure function, changes log\nfunction addOneToLog(x) {\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(addOneToLog);\n//> 2\n//> 3\n//> 4\n```",
