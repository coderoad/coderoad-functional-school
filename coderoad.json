          "explanation": "You've hacked into the school's computer system, and just in time. The grades are in, but you're not too proud of your performance. That's okay, you have a plan: you're going to create a fake report card.\n\nIt would be great if you could `filter` the scores that your parents will see.\n\n`filter` takes a matching condition function and only returns items that result in true. As an example, look at `isA` below:\n\n```\nfunction isA(x) {\n  return x === 'a';\n}\n```\n\n\nLike all of the methods in this chapter, `filter` is already part of the `Array.prototype`, so you can run it following any array. Each item in the array is passed into the params of the condition function, one by one. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).\n\n```\nvar list = ['a', 'b'];\nlist.filter(isA);\n\n// if isA(list[0]), add to output array\n// if isA(list[1]), add to output array\n//\n//> ['a']\n```\n\nIf your data was composed of objects, we could use dot notation to find matches. Checkout `isB` below.\n\n```\nfunction isB(x) {\n  return x.item === 'b'\n}\n\nvar list = [{item: 'a'}, {item: 'b'}];\nlist.filter(isB);\n//> [{item: 'b'}]\n```\n\nWhere were we? Back to filtering our grades.\n\nThere's too much student data in the computer system. We'll have to sort through it. Have a look at an example below:\n\n```\nconsole.log(data[0]);\n//> { course: 'Web Security',\n//    instructor: 'Sue Denim',\n//    name: 'Rebecca Heineman',\n//    score: 93,\n//    grade: 'A' }\n```",

          "explanation": "Your grades are filtered down to your name and good scores - but wouldn't it be better if your best grades were displayed first, at the top? Besides, your parents rarely read anything through.\n\nYou can use the array method `sort` to arrange your data. Let's see how it works.\n\n```js\n['c', 'b', 'a'].sort();\n//> ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\n[3, 2, 1].sort();\n//> [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nBut what about sorting scores inside of an object?\n\n```js\n[{a: 3}, {a: 1}, {a: 2}].sort();\n//> [{a: 3}, {a: 1}, {a: 2}]\n```\n\nThat didn't work. Instead, you can write a custom `compareScore` function.\n\nA sort function takes two params, and compares the first to the second. It should return values saying where the second value should go in the array:\n\n  * -1 : sort to a lower index (front)\n  * 1 : sort to a higher index (back)\n  * 0 : stay the same\n\nAlright, now time to sort your best grades to the top.\n\nFirst you'll need to write a sort condition function called `compareScore`.",

          "explanation": "You've filtered and sorted our data, but neither of those actually change the data.\n\nWouldn't it be simpler if you could just change your grades?\n\nYou can use the array method `map` to run a function that returns changes to your data.\n\nAs an example, let's look at how you would increment each number in an array.\n\n```js\nfunction addOne(num) {\n  return num + 1;\n}\n\n[1, 2, 3].map(addOne);\n//> [2, 3, 4]\n\nfunction addToVal(obj) {\n  obj.val += 1;\n  return obj;\n}\n[{ val: 1}].map(addToVal);\n//> [{ val: 2 }]\n```\n\n`map` can change data, and it can also alter structure of the data you're working with.\n\n```js\nfunction makeObject(num) {\n  return { val: num };\n}\n\n[1, 2].map(makeObject);\n//> [{ val: 1 }, { val: 2 }]\n```\n\nSimilarly, `map` can also restrict the data you want to work with.  See the example below to see another way scores could be sorted.\n\n```js\nmyBest\n  .map(function(student) {\n    return student.score;\n  })\n  .sort()\n  .reverse()\n//> [93, 91, 88, 88, 82, 81, 73]\n```\n\nIn this example, `map` transformed an object with keys of 'title', 'instructor', 'name', 'score' and 'grade', to an array of just scores. Values weren't changed, but rather limited to a smaller subset of scores.\n\n`map` is powerful. Let's see what you can do with it.\n\nThose D & F grades would look a lot better if they suddenly became A's.\n\nLet's go back to before we filtered out the bad grades, and instead change the grades to A's.",

          "explanation": "You've updated your grades, but they're still in an array. It's time to loop over them and log them to the console.\n\n`forEach` has a lot in common with `map`, but there is a big difference. Understanding that difference is important for grasping the difference between:\n\n  * **functional** & **imperative** programming\n  * **pure** & **impure** functions\n\nKnow it or not, you're probably already used to \"imperative\" programming.\n\n> **Imperative** programming describes the order of actions\n\nImperative code tells the computer what to do, step by step.\n\n```js\nvar x = 1; // make a variable\nx = x + 1; // add one\nx = x + 1; // add another\nconsole.log(x);\n//> 3\n```\n\n> **Functional** programming describes the data transformation\n\nFunctional programming is a lot like writing math equations. As in math, 1 + 1 always equals 2.\n\nIn the same way, a **pure** function will always have the same result from a given input. Input 1 -> output 2. Every time.\n\n```js\n// a pure function\nfunction addOne(x) {\n  return x + 1;\n}\naddOne(1)\n//> 2\naddOne(1)\n//> 2\n```\n\nA function is \"pure\" if it doesn't change anything outside of its scope. Pure functions are easy to test, reuse and reason about. In other words, they make your job easier.\n\nOn the other hand, **impure** functions are less predictable. The result may be different if you call it at a later time.\n\n```js\nvar y = 1;\n// impure function\nfunction increment(x) {\n  y += x;\n  return y;\n}\nincrement(1)\n//> 2\nincrement(1)\n//> 3\n```\n\nIt's good practice to ensure your `map` functions remain pure.\n\nBut `forEach` can be a little more dangerous. Why? Let's have a look.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(addOne);\n//> [2, 3, 4]\n\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(addOne);\n//> undefined\n```\n\nWhat? `undefined`? `forEach` runs a function on each item in the array, and doesn't care what the function returns. Functions called by `forEach` must make changes, called **side effects**, to even be noticed.\n\n```js\n// impure function, changes log\nfunction addOneToLog(x) {\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(addOneToLog);\n//> 2\n//> 3\n//> 4\n```\n\nNow that we see how `forEach` works, let's use it to make calls to the `console`.",

          "explanation": "Before we've been working on a structured set of student data.\n\n```js\n// array of students\n[\n  {\n  \"title\": \"Relational Databases\",\n  \"instructor\": \"Sean Quentin Lewis\",\n  \"name\": \"Rebecca Heineman\",\n  \"score\": 71,\n  \"grade\": \"C\"\n  }\n// students in courses...\n]\n```\n\nTo be safe, let's now work on the original data set. Notice how it is structured differently.\n\n```js\n// array of courses\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Relational Databases\",\n    \"instructor\": \"Sean Quentin Lewis\",\n    \"students\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Rebecca Heineman\",\n        \"score\": 71,\n        \"grade\": \"C\"\n      }\n    // students...\n    ]\n  }\n  // courses...\n]\n```\n\nIn this data set, there is an array of students within an array of courses. So how can we recreate our original array of students from the courses? We can use `concat`.\n\nWeird things happen when you start combining arrays. `concat` brings sanity.\n\n```js\n[1, 2] + [3, 4];\n//> \"1, 23, 4\"\n\n[1, 2].push([3, 4]);\n//> 3\n\n[1, 2].join([3, 4]);\n//> \"13, 42\"\n\n[1, 2].concat([3, 4]);\n//> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nUnfortunately, Javascript is missing a built in array method to concat multiple arrays together: let's call it `flatten` (often called `concatAll`). `flatten` should loop over an array and concat each element.\n\n```js\nvar start = [{\n  a: 1,\n  c: [\n    { b: 1 }\n  ]\n}, {\n  a: 2,\n  c: [\n    { b: 2 }, { b: 3 }\n  ]\n}];\n\nvar middle = start.map(function(outer) {\n  return outer.c.map(function(inner) {\n    return {\n      a: outer.a,\n      b: inner.b\n    };\n  });\n});\n//> [ [{ a: 1, b: 1 }], [{a: 2, b: 2}, {a: 2, b: 3}] ]\n\nvar end = pre.flatten();\n//> [{a: 1, b: 1}, {a: 2, b: 2}, {a: 2, b: 3}]\n```\n\nBack to business.\n\nWe have a suspect in mind: a classmate named \"Hack Kerr\". He's a nice guy, and he's always been friendly to you - but there's something suspicious about him: his name.\n\nFirst let's recreate our student array of data from the course data.",
