          "explanation": "You've hacked into the school's computer system, and just in time. The grades are in, aren't you're not too proud of your performance. But that's okay, you have a plan: you're going to create a fake report card.\n\nIt would be great if you could `filter` the scores that your parents will see. A `filter` takes a matching condition function and only returns items that result in true. As an example, look at `isA` below:\n\n```\nfunction isA(x) {\n  return x === 'a';\n}\n```\n\n\nLike all of the methods in this chapter, `filter` is already part of the `Array.prototype`, so you can run it following any array. Each item in the array is passed into the params of the condition function, one by one.\n\n```\nvar list = ['a', 'b'];\nlist.filter(isA);\n\n// if isA(list[0]), add to output array\n// if isA(list[1]), add to output array\n//\n//> ['a']\n```\n\nIf your data was composed of objects, we could use dot notation to find matches. Checkout `isB` below.\n\n```\nfunction isB(x) {\n  return x.item === 'b'\n}\n\nvar list = [{item: 'a'}, {item: 'b'}];\nlist.filter(isB);\n//> [{item: 'b'}]\n```\n\nWhere were we? Back to filtering our grades.\n\nThere's too much student data in the computer system. We'll have to sort through it. Have a look at an example below:\n\n```\nconsole.log(data[0]);\n//> { course: 'Web Security',\n//    instructor: 'Sue Denim',\n//    name: 'Rebecca Heineman',\n//    score: 93,\n//    grade: 'A' }\n```",

          "explanation": "Your grades are filtered down to your name and good scores - but wouldn't it be better if your best grades were shown at the top? Besides, your parents rarely read all the way down to the bottom.\n\nWe can use the array method `sort` to arrange our data. Let's see how it works.\n\n```js\n['c', 'b', 'a'].sort();\n//> ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\n[3, 2, 1].sort();\n//> [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nBut what about sorting the scores inside of an object? We can write a custom `compareScore` function.\n\nA sort function takes two params, and compares the first to the second. It should return values saying where the second value should go:\n\n  * -1 : sort to a lower index\n  * 1 : sort to a higher index\n  * 0 : stay the same\n\nAlright, now time to sort your best grades to the top.",
