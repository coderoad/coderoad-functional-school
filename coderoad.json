          "explanation": "You've hacked into the school's computer system, and just in time. The grades are in, aren't you're not too proud of your performance. But that's okay, you have a plan: you're going to create a fake report card.\n\nIt would be great if you could `filter` the scores that your parents will see. A `filter` takes a matching condition function and only returns items that result in true. As an example, look at `isA` below:\n\n```\nfunction isA(x) {\n  return x === 'a';\n}\n```\n\n\nLike all of the methods in this chapter, `filter` is already part of the `Array.prototype`, so you can run it following any array. Each item in the array is passed into the params of the condition function, one by one.\n\n```\nvar list = ['a', 'b'];\nlist.filter(isA);\n\n// if isA(list[0]), add to output array\n// if isA(list[1]), add to output array\n//\n//> ['a']\n```\n\nIf your data was composed of objects, we could use dot notation to find matches. Checkout `isB` below.\n\n```\nfunction isB(x) {\n  return x.item === 'b'\n}\n\nvar list = [{item: 'a'}, {item: 'b'}];\nlist.filter(isB);\n//> [{item: 'b'}]\n```\n\nWhere were we? Back to filtering our grades.\n\nThere's too much student data in the computer system. We'll have to sort through it. Have a look at an example below:\n\n```\nconsole.log(data[0]);\n//> { course: 'Web Security',\n//    instructor: 'Sue Denim',\n//    name: 'Rebecca Heineman',\n//    score: 93,\n//    grade: 'A' }\n```",
