      "description": "Array -> Array of items that match a condition\n\nYou've hacked into the school's computer system, and just in time. The grades are in, but you're not too proud of your performance. That's okay, you have a plan: you're going to create a fake report card.\n\nIt would be great if you could `filter` the scores that your parents will see.\n\n`filter` takes a matching condition function and only returns items that result in true. As an example, look at `isA` below:\n\n```js\nfunction isA(x) {\n  return x === 'a';\n}\n```\n\n\nLike all of the methods in this chapter, `filter` is already part of the `Array.prototype`, so you can run it following any array. Each item in the array is passed into the params of the condition function, one by one. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).\n\n```js\nconst list = ['a', 'b'];\nlist.filter(isA);\n\n// if isA(list[0]), add to output array\n// if isA(list[1]), add to output array\n//\n//> ['a']\n```\n\nIf your data was composed of objects, we could use dot notation to find matches. Checkout `isB` below.\n\n```js\nfunction isB(x) {\n  return x.item === 'b'\n}\n\nconst list = [{item: 'a'}, {item: 'b'}];\nlist.filter(isB);\n//> [{item: 'b'}]\n```\n\nWhere were we? Back to filtering our grades.\n\nThere's too much student data in the computer system. We'll have to sort through it. Have a look at an example below:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(students[0]);\n//> { course: 'Web Security',\n//    instructor: 'Sue Denim',\n//    name: 'Rebecca Heineman',\n//    score: 93,\n//    grade: 'A' }\n```",

Values weren't changed, but rather limited to a smaller subset of scores.\n\n`map` is powerful. Let's see what you can do with it.\n\nThose D & F grades would look a lot better if they suddenly became A's.\n\nLet's go back to before we filtered out the bad grades, and instead change the grades to A's.",

It's time to loop over them and log them to the console.\n\nTo open the console, go to *View* > *Developer* > *Toggle Developer Tools*. Or press *cmd+opt+I* on Mac, *ctrl+alt+I* on Windows.\n\n`forEach` has a lot in common with `map`, but there is a big difference. Understanding that difference is important for grasping the difference between:\n\n  * **functional** & **imperative** programming\n  * **pure** & **impure** functions\n\nKnow it or not, you're probably already used to \"imperative\" programming.\n\n> **Imperative** programming describes the order of actions\n\nImperative code tells the computer what to do, step by step.\n\n```js\nlet x = 1; // make a variable\nx = x + 1; // add one\nx = x + 1; // add another\nconsole.log(x);\n//> 3\n```\n\n> **Functional** programming describes the data transformation\n\nFunctional programming is a lot like writing math equations. As in math, 1 + 1 always equals 2.\n\nIn the same way, a **pure** function will always have the same result from a given input. Input 1 -> output 2. Every time.\n\n```js\n// a pure function\nfunction addOne(x) {\n  return x + 1;\n}\naddOne(1)\n//> 2\naddOne(1)\n//> 2\n```\n\nA function is \"pure\" if it doesn't change anything outside of its scope. Pure functions are easy to test, reuse and reason about. In other words, they make your job easier.\n\nOn the other hand, **impure** functions are less predictable. The result may be different if you call it at a later time.\n\n```js\nlet y = 1;\n// impure function\nfunction increment(x) {\n  y += x;\n  return y;\n}\nincrement(1)\n//> 2\nincrement(1)\n//> 3\n```\n\nIt's good practice to ensure your `map` functions remain pure.\n\nBut `forEach` can be a little more dangerous. Why? Let's have a look.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(addOne);\n//> [2, 3, 4]\n\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(addOne);\n//> undefined\n```\n\nWhat? `undefined`? `forEach` runs a function on each item in the array, and doesn't care what the function returns. Functions called by `forEach` must make changes, called **side effects**, to even be noticed.\n\n```js\n// impure function, changes log\nfunction addOneToLog(x) {\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\n[1, 2, 3].forEach(addOneToLog);\n//> 2\n//> 3\n//> 4\n```\n\nNow that we see how `forEach` works, let's use it to make calls to the `console`.",

Notice how it is structured differently.\n\n```js\n// array of courses\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Relational Databases\",\n    \"instructor\": \"Sean Quentin Lewis\",\n    \"students\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Rebecca Heineman\",\n        \"score\": 71,\n        \"grade\": \"C\"\n      }\n    // students...\n    ]\n  }\n  // courses...\n]\n```\n\nIn this data set, there is an array of students within an array of courses. So how can we recreate our original array of students from the courses?\n\nWeird things happen when you start combining arrays. We can use `concat` to bring sanity.\n\n```js\n[1, 2] + [3, 4];\n//> \"1, 23, 4\"\n\n[1, 2].push([3, 4]);\n//> 3\n\n[1, 2].join([3, 4]);\n//> \"13, 42\"\n\n[1, 2].concat([3, 4]);\n//> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nUnfortunately, Javascript is missing a built in array method to concat multiple arrays together: let's call it `flatten` (sometimes called `concatAll`).\n\n`flatten` should loop over an array and `concat` each element.\n\nLet's look at an abstraction of what we need to do:\n\n```js\nconst start = [{\n  a: 1,\n  c: [\n    { b: 1 }\n  ]\n}, {\n  a: 2,\n  c: [\n    { b: 2 }, { b: 3 }\n  ]\n}];\n\nconst middle = start.map(function(outer) {\n  return outer.c.map(function(inner) {\n    return {\n      a: outer.a,\n      b: inner.b\n    };\n  });\n});\n//> [ [{ a: 1, b: 1 }], [{a: 2, b: 2}, {a: 2, b: 3}] ]\n\nconst end = pre.flatten();\n//> [{a: 1, b: 1}, {a: 2, b: 2}, {a: 2, b: 3}]\n```\n\nBack to business.\n\nWe have a suspect in mind: a classmate named \"Hack Kerr\". He's a nice guy, and he's always been friendly to you - but there's something suspicious about him: his name.\n\nWe'll test out flatten, then re-create our student array of data from the original course data.",

For this, we'll have to do some basic statistical calculations. We'll need a new tool for transforming arrays into different data representations.\n\n`map` has a major limitation: it will always output the same number of elements as the input array.\n\nWhen you want to transform data into something different, you'll likely want to use `reduce`.\n\nReduce requires two parameters:\n\n  * the running total (set by an initialValue)\n  * the next value in the array\n\n```js\nfunction add(total, next) {\n    console.log(`add(${total}, ${next}) -> ${total + next}`)\n    return total + next\n}\n\nconst initialValue = 100;\n[1, 5, 10].reduce(add, initialValue); // initial value\n\n// add(100, 1) -> 101\n// add(101, 5) -> 106\n// add(106, 10) -> 116\n//> 116\n```\n\nNotice in the example we input an array of 3 items and output a single number. The data has been transformed.\n\nIt takes a while to wrap your head around `reduce`, but once you do, you'll see it's usefulness everywhere.\n\nYou may have noticed we've already used `reduce` to `flatten` our arrays.\n\n```js\nArray.prototype.flatten = function() {\n  return this.reduce((a, b) => a.concat(b), []);\n};\n```\n\nWith `flatten`, the initialValue was set to an empty array which each value was `concat` onto.\n\nDo some practice with `reduce`, before you use it to narrow down a cheating suspect.",
